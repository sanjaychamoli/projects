# projects
A few of my c++ projects which were a part of my course


/**********************************/

CFD_Solver:
A CFD solver which solves the navier strokes equation.


/**********************************/

Conjugate_Gradient_MPI:

An itterative algorithm solver which uses the conjugate gradient method is an algorithm for the numerical solution of particular systems of linear equations, namely those whose matrix is symmetric and positive-definite.

Parallelization is implemented using MPI.



/*********************************/

Matrix_mul:

A code for matrix multiplication. The code is optimized for single core use.


/*********************************/

Red_Black_GaussSeidel:

An itterative algorithm solver which uses the Red Black Gauss Seidel method.

Parallelization is implemented using OpenMP.
